Compatibility
-------------

We rely on JavaScript to handle front-end events (e.g. trans-compilation of Markdown to HTML, uploading image).

.. Note::
    **MarkdownX** currently supports browsers compatible with :guilabel:`ECMAScript 5` (approved in 2011), which
    includes all major browsers (see the details on `browser compatibilities`_).
